        <b>All Souls’ Day</b> is observed every year on November 2. 
        It is a day dedicated to remembering and praying for the souls of the faithful departed. 
        For Catholics, it is a time to honor loved ones who have passed away and to offer prayers for their eternal rest.

        On this day, families often visit cemeteries to light candles, bring flowers, and clean the graves of their relatives. 
        Many also attend Mass or special church services to pray for the departed.

        The lighting of candles is seen as a symbol of hope and a way of keeping the memory of the dead alive.
        In the Philippines and other countries, All Souls’ Day is part of a wider tradition known as Undas, 
        which begins on November 1 with All Saints’ Day.

        These days are not only moments of prayer but also family gatherings where stories are shared, and the lives of loved ones are remembered.
        All Souls’ Day carries a message of faith, remembrance, and love. 
        It reminds people of the importance of family ties, even beyond death, and strengthens the belief in the hope of eternal life. 
        More than just a religious practice, it has also become a cultural tradition that shows respect and care for those who have gone before us.
